Now I am using double counter. It seemed good at first, as it blocks most attempts at getting an alt in. However multiple people joining have struggled to get it working, either it coming up as a potential virus, or the website not loading etc. Looking into it further there are a lot of mixed reviews of double counter that I am seeing. So I have a few questions.

    Is it worth keeping? If so, how am I able to help people who are having trouble verifying?

    If its not worth Keeping, is there an alternative you would recommend?
