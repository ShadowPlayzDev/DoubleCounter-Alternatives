Now I am using double counter. It seemed good at first, as it blocks most attempts at getting an alt in. However multiple people joining have struggled to get it working, either it coming up as a potential virus, or the website not loading etc. Looking into it further there are a lot of mixed reviews of double counter that I am seeing. So I have a few questions.

Is it worth keeping? If so, how am I able to help people who are having trouble verifying?

If its not worth Keeping, is there an alternative you would recommend?

I've used this bot and it has its flaws.Mostly these flaws:
- Malware ads on their verify page. They are aware of this and try to get rid of it. Only way to get rid of it or to keep your members safe is by paying for their premium-bot.

- Once registred = permanent registred. So there is ZERO room for mistakes. Used wrong account to verify? Old account gone and using new one? You're screwed for life. They won't change their global database due to security reasons, which I can understand due to them storing IP adresses to prevent alts.

- The dashboard is sometimes not working.- When using the global database of this bot. Your account gets registerd in one big database which almost all servers with this bot use. So when you register on your main account, you're verified for all servers. Used the wrong account or lost accces to old acccount? You can't access all servers using this bot.

- When a member tries to verify using Iphone (safari) or on their Mobile-Data. The bot labels this as VPN-users and denies verification. You then need to join their supportserver for help.

- You can't have familymembers joining the same server using this bot. Only one person per Ip-adress/household. This makes some thing very difficcult because only the first person in your household can access the server and succesfully verify. This wil also lock his/hers account to your IP-adress pernamently.

- Detected as a alt? You need to contact the staffteam of that server to let you manually verified. Otherwise you're never able to join with your account.

- Their supportserver is very crowded and full of people not reading the FAQ (/faq command). So when asking for help in their spportserver, you're easilly getting overcrowded by people asking questions or not listening. So you need to make a ticket in the server to get help.

So keep this in mind. Its a very strong/secure bot. Works great when everything goes right. But also very big obstacle for people making mistakes or being young/naive. It keeps away ALL alt's. But it also keeps away everyone who made a mistake while verifying their account or gets labled as an alt-account. This even happened to me because I forgot to verify my own main-account on this bot as serveradmin before testing with an alt-account. Now my alt-account is pernmamently locked as main-account in their database and I can never join a server again with my main-account when that server is using Doublecounter bot.

So when using this bot. Make sure you have a support-line (email, ticketsbot etc) for people not able to join your server.

~~So when you use this bot. Go immedailly to the dashboard -> configuration and set it to local database. This will prevent the server from using the global database and pre-defining members as alts when they made a mistake in another server like I did in my testserver. Otherwise you will have a lot of members not being able to verify because they are labled as an alt-account in another server uing the global database.~~Edit: I tested this out and even when using local database, they put you in the global database as well. So I don't understand why they have this feature. I believe to put you in the global database, but not deny you when your first account in the server was not the main in the global-database

Quick read of it, it seems flawed, very flawed. Let alone annoying.

There's no simple way of checking for alt accounts that works flawless. Best I could think of is requiring phone verification, but that wouldn't stop all alts either.
